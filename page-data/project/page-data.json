Bizjapan was founded in 2011 and became an NPO in 2017. We have successfully completed 55 projects so far. {breakingLine} Currently, 30 members from about 10 countries, mainly students from the University of Tokyo, Waseda University, and Keio University, and especially this year, under the slogan “Because we love it.” Ten projects are in progress, from supporting studying abroad, local revitalization, data science, art, to African startups and space medicine. {breakingLine} Bizjapan is an NPO where students beyond the difference of gender, nationality, university, and interest come together. Here, you can pursue a project of your own, with the belief in yourself and your critical eye.","values.firstvalue.title":"Global","values.firstvalue.desc":"“Global” as Bizjapan puts it is NOT just an “interaction with international students.” It also means crossing over the numerous boundaries — boundaries of countries, fields, age, gender, universities, culture, and so on. Here we assemble, surpassing all those unnecessary boundaries. By getting over them, we co-create and make an impact on the world.","values.secondvalue.title":"Entrepreneurship","values.secondvalue.desc":"“Entrepreneurship” as Bizjapan puts it is NOT “the act of setting up a business.” We consider it as a mentality where passion and novelty meets, and it rests in the mind of those who wish to make an impact on the world. Sympathy from others, social significance, sustainable model, recirculation of resources — everything starts from here.","partners":"Our activities are supported by the following companies and groups.","contact":"Do you want to know more about us?

Sometimes it can be hosting a workshop aimed towards people outside the community or an event co-hosted with companies. On the other hand it can be a study tour involving many associations or providing workshops exclusively for our members. {breakingLine} The driving force of initiating projects is not a simple “what to do” but rather an intensive process of thinking “what kind of society is ideal for us to live in”. Each project focuses on creating and carrying out their plans to realize it.","annualreport.2015":"","annualreport.2016":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4Ox1EpBqvCXdUoxb3hPOGhxc28/view","annualreport.2017":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1amhkSsVRgGh_mF0hQh4eAy2t5qLJj4I_/view","annualreport.2018":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hQuBPJQtIK6RK50JSSroBUkVjE2cFIZB/view","annualreport.2019":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KMtQ5EI11infL3ZUbLSdRr_spx_5rJgl/view","annualreport.desc":"Bizjapan publishes an annual report to introduce members’ activities and event participations, through Project Reports and Partner Introductions.

I recently came to realize that everyone has a start and is fighting back a bit of fear everyday. {breakingLine} Colorful variations of “passion” gather, meet, and blossom here. Even in a storm, stamped by strangers, the flowers stand open. This garden never fails to offer me comfort, rush, and courage. {breakingLine} Under the motto of “Because we love it.” and with a sense of ownership towards our society, each one of us strives to open up our paths. To continue our role as a platform for entrepreneurs, Bizjapan will keep moving forward.","corporateinfo.name.title":"Official Name","corporateinfo.name.desc":"NPO Bizjapan","corporateinfo.founder.title":"Founder","corporateinfo.founder.desc":"Sho Hayashi","corporateinfo.establishment.title":"Establishment","corporateinfo.establishment.desc":"November, 24th, 2016","corporateinfo.office.title":"Office","corporateinfo.office.desc":"7F, Meiwa-Hongo-building, 4-1-3, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo","stats.member.title":"Member Shift","stats.member.desc":"Since its establishment in 2011 by 4 original members, Bizjapan has developed in these 7 years to as many as 216 members.
